# taskPulse-Next.js

A modern task management application built with Next.js, designed to streamline your workflow and enhance productivity.

## Project Description

taskPulse is a web application crafted using Next.js, offering a user-friendly interface for managing tasks, setting priorities, and tracking progress. It leverages the power of React and Next.js to provide a seamless and responsive experience. This application is designed to be easily customizable and scalable, making it suitable for both personal and team use.

Key features include:

*   **Task Creation:** Easily add new tasks with descriptions, due dates, and priority levels.
*   **Task Management:** Organize tasks into lists, mark them as complete, and edit details as needed.
*   **User Interface:** Clean and intuitive design for easy navigation and a pleasant user experience.

## Getting Started

To get started with taskPulse-Next.js, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    # or
    pnpm install
    # or
    bun install
    3.  **Run the development server:**
    *   **Creating a new task:** Click on the "Add Task" button and fill in the required details (task name, description, due date, priority).
*   **Managing tasks:** Use the task list to view, edit, and delete tasks. You can also mark tasks as complete.
*   **Filtering tasks:** Use the filter options to view tasks based on their status (e.g., pending, completed) or priority.


## API Service (`services/api.tsx`)

The `services/api.tsx` file contains the API service layer, responsible for handling communication with the backend. It encapsulates all API requests, providing a centralized location for managing data fetching and manipulation.

**Purpose:**

typescript
// services/api.tsx
import axios from 'axios';

const API_BASE_URL = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL || 'http://localhost:8000/api';

const api = axios.create({
  baseURL: API_BASE_URL,
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  },
});

export const getAllTasks = async () => {
  try {
    const response = await api.get('/tasks');
    return response.data;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error fetching tasks:", error);
    throw error;
  }
};

export default api;
## `app/layout.tsx` and `app/page.tsx`

*   **`app/layout.tsx`:** This file defines the root layout for the application. It wraps all pages and provides a consistent UI structure, including elements like headers, footers, and global styles. It's the ideal place to include shared components and set up the overall look and feel of the application.
*   **`app/page.tsx`:** This file represents the main landing page of the application. It contains the primary content and components displayed when a user visits the root URL (`/`). In the context of taskPulse, it likely contains the task list and task creation components.
